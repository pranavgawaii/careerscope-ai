## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follows these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Python 3.x (optional, for local server) or any static file server

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranavgawaii/careerscope-ai.git
   cd careerscope-ai
   ```

2. **Start a local server**
   Since this is a static site, you can open `index.html` directly, but for the best experience (avoiding CORS issues with some assets), run a simple server:
   
   Using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. **View the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Professional & Trustworthy:** A deep Navy/Slate color palette conveys seriousness and stability.
- **Analytical:** Data-heavy dashboard visualizations using 3D CSS transforms.
- **Student-First:** UI elements focus on clarity, constructive feedback, and distinct "Action Plans".
